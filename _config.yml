  Hi, I'm Fabricio, a Computer Scientist working in the area of Machine Learning and more general Data Science & Statistics.
  I'm currently a PhD Student at the University of Basel, where I'm researching ways to model different kinds of ornithological data.
  This ranges from modeling nocturnal migration events based on large-scale radar data to estimating species distribution models of birds based on citizen-science observations.
  
  On the methodological side my interest lie in Gaussian Processes, Density Estimation (including deep generative models and flows), and Implicit Representation Networks.
  Within the University I'm further involved in mentoring Bachelor's and Master's theses and assist in the 'Scientific Computing' lecture held at our department. 
  Finally, I regularly review submitted papers for some of the major ML Conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).

  In more practical terms I have worked quite a bit with common Machine Learning and Data Science frameworks, most notably Tensorflow 2.* & Pytorch and derivative libraries for scalable Gaussian Process (GPflow, GPytorch).
  Aside from that, I'm comfortable with the more general python scientific stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, ...) and have some experience in processing geo-data as well as working with (PostgreSQL) Databases.
  While there is a wide range of frameworks and languages I haven't worked with, I'm always happy to delve into new technologies and frameworks.

  A more complete list of programming languages, frameworks and tools I've worked with:
  - Programming languages: <mark>Python</mark> (most skilled), <mark>R</mark>(basic), <mark>Javascript</mark>(basic) 
  - Deep Learning: <mark>Tensorflow 1.* & 2.*</mark>  <mark>Pytorch</mark>
  - Gaussian Processes: <mark>GPflow</mark>, <mark>GPytorch</mark>
  - Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing: <mark>Python Scientific Stack</mark>
  - Data Extraction: <mark>pandas</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Google Earth Engine</mark>
  - Workflow: <mark>conda/virtual environments</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, <mark>linux</mark>, <mark>SLURM</mark>

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
